# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int LengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        var hs = new HashSet<char>();

        var result = 0;
        var beginIndex = 0;
        var max = 0;
        
        for (var i = 0; i < s.Length; i++)
        {
            var current = s[i];
            if (!hs.Contains(current))
            {
                hs.Add(current);
                max++;
                if (max > result)
                    result = max;
            }
            else
            {
                hs.Remove(s[beginIndex]);
                beginIndex++;
                max--;
                i--;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
