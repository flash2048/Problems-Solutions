# 1221. Split a String in Balanced Strings
https://leetcode.com/problems/split-a-string-in-balanced-strings

**Balanced** strings are those that have an equal quantity of `'L'` and `'R'` characters.

Given a **balanced** string `s`, split it into some number of substrings such that:

*   Each substring is balanced.

Return _the **maximum** number of balanced strings you can obtain._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", because the 2nd and 5th substrings are not balanced.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "LLLLRRRR"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= s.length <= 1000`
*   `s[i]` is either `'L'` or `'R'`.
*   `s` is a **balanced** string.

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int BalancedStringSplit(string s) {
        var count = 0;
        var balance = 0;
        foreach (var element in s)
        {
            if (element.Equals('R'))
                balance++;

            if (element.Equals('L'))
                balance--;
                
            if (balance == 0)
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
